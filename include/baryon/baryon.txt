J AND S VALUES ARE TWICE THEIR PHYSICAL VALUES
J=1/2 is stored as J=1
J=3/2 is stored as J=3
This was done to store them as integers.

Positive parity is stored as 0 for (-1)^0 and negative as 1 for (-1)^1

states are labeled in this order:
Pf,J,Pj,M,N,L,np,lp,nl,ll,S,Ps
0  1 2  3 4 5 6  7  8  9 10 11

polytype: Hermite (true) or Laguerre (false) quadrature
	if(polytype) XX=r, else XX=r^2
     	if(polytype) dx=XW*r^2, else dx=XW*r/2=XW*sqrt(x)/2

k is list of variable type: 
 	2s place: 0 for 1D lambda, 1 for 1D rho
 	1s place: 0 for position, 1 for momentum,
		used in scalar, spin-spin, and Dirac delta
 	ignored otherwise, still need to include
tens is list of term type:
 	0 for scalar
 	1 for spin-spin
 	2 for spin tensor
 	3 for spin vector 2 body (do not include 1/rho in f)
 	4 for spin vector 3 body
	5 for Dirac delta
spin is list of spin configurations (formerly tens2), one of:
 	tens=0,2,3,4,5: ignored, still need to include a value to comply
 	tens=1: 11,22,33 for S_i^2
 		12,21,13,31,23,32 for S_i.S_j
 			only 12 and 21 allowed for 1D
rot is list of Moshinsky rotation index
pars is list of paramaters for use in the vector, ignored otherwise
